# Example Flex-blox

Recently, I created a project using only HTML and CSS. I wanted to challenge myself and force the use of CSS without JavaScript for people who are just starting out with CSS and may find it complicated.

This project covers topics such as transitions, positions and selectors, as well as other advanced CSS functionality.

I would like to invite those who might benefit from this project to check it out. Although it is simple, I used Sass to modularize the code. I did this to further improve my CSS skills and so that people can get ideas or inspiration for creating similar components.

If they find something useful in the code, they can use it in their own projects.

### Languages used:

- Html
- Css/Scss
